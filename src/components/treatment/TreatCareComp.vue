                    <p><span>To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.</span> However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.</p>
                    <p>Antibiotics do not help, as they do not work against viruses. Treatment aims to relieve the symptoms while your body fights the illness. You'll need to stay in isolation, away from other people, until you have recovered.</p>
